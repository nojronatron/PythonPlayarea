# PythonPlayarea
Online storage of my Python training projects

After a few years using PowerShell, and recently learning C#, I decided to try and learn a not-just-for-Windows
interpreted or compiled language. Recent work at Citrix had pointed to Python as a well-developed and often-used
language that could fit the need.

During the winter of 2015 I began doing my own studying and ended up taking an instructor-led class (to speed up
the learning process). This resulted in LOTS OF HOMEWORK, that I needed to juggle between multiple laptops and a
few computers. GitHub will serve as a remote I can access and continue work anywhere I am.

Contributions
There are not contribution expectations, so don't bother. I'm not making anything too interesting anyways.

Comments
Are welcome. If you see stupid stuff in my code (or something really smart) I wouldn't mind reading about it.
